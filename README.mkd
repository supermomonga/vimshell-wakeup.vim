# VimShell Wakeup

Sometimes we run the command which needs too long time.

To use vimshell-wakeup.vim, vimshell notificate you by speaking when the command finished.


# Installation

I recommend you to use NeoBundle.vim to manage Vim Plugins.
If you are using NeoBundle.vim, you only need to write following lines to your .vimrc and just execute :NeoBundleInstall.

    NeoBundle 'supermomonga/vimshell-wakeup.vim', {'depends' : [ 'Shougo/vimshell', 'supermomonga/shaberu.vim' ]}
